# Python Decorators – 0x01

This project demonstrates how to use Python decorators to simplify and improve database operations.

## Tasks
- **0-log_queries.py** – Logs SQL queries before execution.
- **1-with_db_connection.py** – Automatically opens and closes SQLite connections.
- **2-transactional.py** – Wraps operations in a transaction (commit/rollback).
- **3-retry_on_failure.py** – Retries failed queries for resilience.
- **4-cache_query.py** – Caches results to avoid redundant queries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- SQLite3
- Each script is independent and can be tested individually.

## Usage
Run each file using:
```bash
python3 <filename>.py
