"""
Task 1: Handle Database Connections with a Decorator

This script implements a decorator `with_db_connection` that automatically
opens a SQLite database connection, passes it to the wrapped function,
and ensures the connection is closed afterward.

This approach avoids repetitive connection setup and cleanup in each function.

    Decorator to manage database connections.

    It opens a connection to `users.db`, injects it as the first argument

    after the function execution â€” even if an error occurs.

    Args:
        func (function): The target database function.

    Returns:
        function: The wrapped function with automatic DB connection handling.
